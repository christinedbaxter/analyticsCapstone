# Current Status

In Progress

# Project Overview

In this section you should provide a brief overview of the project, what it is about, and what it aims to achieve. This will help readers quickly understand what the project is all about. Include overarching objectives, key stakeholders, and any other relevant information.

# Business Issues

In this section, you should outline the key business objectives and questions that the project aims to answer. You can also note any specific analyses or types of data that stakeholders are interested in.

# Installation and Setup

In this section, provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine. This includes any necessary dependencies, software requirements, and installation steps. Make sure to include clear and concise instructions so that others can easily replicate your setup.

I like to structure it as below -

## Codes and Resources Used

In this section I give user the necessary information about the software requirements.

- **Editor Used:**  Informing the user of the editor used to produce the project.
- **Python Version:** Informing the user of the version of python used for this project. If you are using some other language such as R, you can mention that as well.

## Python Packages Used

In this section, I include all the necessary dependencies needed to reproduce the project, so that the reader can install them before replicating the project. I categorize the long list of packages used as -

- **General Purpose:** General purpose packages like `urllib, os, request`, and many more.
- **Data Manipulation:** Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `pandas, numpy` and others.
- **Data Visualization:** Include packages which were used to plot graphs in the analysis or for understanding the ML modelling such as `seaborn, matplotlib` and others.
- **Machine Learning:** This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `scikit, tensorflow`, etc.

The level of granularity you want to provide for the above list is entirely up to you. You can also add a few more levels, such as those for statistical analysis or data preparation, or you can simply incorporate them into the above list as is.

# Data

The very crucial part of any data science project is dataset. Therefore list all the data sources used in the project, including links to the original data, descriptions of the data, and any pre-processing steps that were taken.

I structure this as follows -

## Source Data

In this section, I list all of the data that was used, along with the source link and a few lines that describe each data. You can also explain each of the data attributes in greater detail if you wish. Describe the data set: source, key variables, data types, and any initial observations.

## Data Acquisition

Data collection is not always as simple as downloading from Kaggle or any open source website; it can also be gathered through API calls or online scraping. So you can elaborate on this step in this section so that the reader can obtain the dataset by following your instructions.

## Data Preprocessing

Acquired data is not always squeaky clean, so preprocessing them are an integral part of any data analysis. In this section you can talk about the same. Include initial data quality assessment: missing values, outliers, duplicates, etc.

# Code structure

Explain the code structure and how it is organized, including any significant files and their purposes. This will help others understand how to navigate your project and find specific components.

Here is the basic suggested skeleton for your data science repo (you can structure your repository as needed ):

```bash
├── data
│   ├── data1.csv
│   ├── data2.csv
│   ├── cleanedData
│       ├── cleaneddata1.csv
|       └── cleaneddata2.csv
├── data_acquisition.py
├── data_preprocessing.ipynb
├── data_analysis.ipynb
├── data_modelling.ipynb
├── Img

│   └── Headerheader.jpg
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

# Results and evaluation

Provide an overview of the results of your project, including any relevant metrics and graphs. Include explanations of any evaluation methodologies and how they were used to assess the quality of the model. You can also make it appealing by including any pictures of your analysis or visualizations.

## Exploratory Analysis and Modeling

- Describe the statistical models and machine learning techniques used for analysis.
- List key findings and insights gained from the modeling.

**Models Used**:  

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest, etc.

---

## Data Validation

- Explain how you validated the data and models.
- Discuss any iterations or refinements made during this step.

---

## Data Visualization and Presentation

- Describe the visualization tools and techniques used to present the findings.
- Explain how the data story was crafted to convey the value of your analysis to clients.

**Visualization Tools**:  

- Tableau
- Python Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)

# Future work

Outline potential future work that can be done to extend the project or improve its functionality. This will help others understand the scope of your project and identify areas where they can contribute.

# GitHub Versioning/Workflow

By adhering to the workflow discussed below, the project maintains a high level of code integrity, streamlines collaboration, and enables seamless tracking of project milestones.

## Branching Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Created an initial `develop` branch as the base for development.
2. **Feature Branches**: For each major stage of the project, a dedicated feature branch was created off of the `develop` branch.

## Commit and Merge Workflow

1. **Commit Changes**: After the completion of each stage, all changes were committed to the respective feature branch.
2. **Code Reviews and Merges**: The feature branch was then merged into the `develop` branch post-review.
3. **Creating New Feature Branches**: A new feature branch was created from the updated `develop` branch for the next stage of the project.
4. **Final Merge**: Upon completion of all stages, the `develop` branch was merged into the `main` branch through a pull request.
